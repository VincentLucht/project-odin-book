# Reddnir
A full featured reddit-like community based social media platform, where users can create posts and comments. Built as the final project of [Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com).

## ‚ú® Key Features
**Communities:** Create and manage communities with custom icons, banners, and up to 3 topics. Set privacy levels (public, restricted, or private) that control member access and content visibility

**Posts:** Create posts in communities with full upvote/downvote functionality. Browse posts using multiple sorting algorithms (new, popular, hot) and discover popular posts in the /popular feed

**Comments:** Engage in threaded discussions with theoretically unlimited nesting levels. Comment on posts, reply to other comments, and upvote/downvote them

**Users:** Create accounts to unlock full platform features including post/comment saving, karma tracking, and comprehensive post/comment history viewing

**Moderation Tools:** Community moderators can manage reports, handle mod mail, and control member permissions (approve/ban users) through dedicated moderation tools

**Customizability:** Customize your community, post, or user profile!

**Security and Validation:** Secure user authentication with role-based access control ensuring private communities remain exclusive to authorized members

## üåü Technical Highlights
**Scale & Architecture:** 40,000+ lines of TypeScript code across a full-stack Reddit-like platform with complex database relationships for communities, posts, comments, moderation systems, and more 

**Frontend Performance:** React with advanced optimization including virtualization for large lists, pagination, responsive design, and smooth user interactions using Tailwind CSS 

**Backend Engineering:** Node.js/Express REST API with 100+ secure endpoints, comprehensive input validation, role-based access control, and PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and raw SQL queries for advanced queries
